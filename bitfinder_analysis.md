# BitFinder Token Economy Document v2 - Analysis

## Core Economic Model

### Central Mechanism
- **10-20% of ad revenue** is converted to $BTT tokens
- Distribution to users and NFT holders at dynamic rates
- Creates direct link between user activity → platform growth → token value

## Token System Overview

### 1. $BROWSE (Soulbound Reputation Token)
**Pre-TGE Phase:**
- Non-transferable, soulbound token
- Earned through daily "genuine and meaningful usage"
- Requirements include:
  - Proof of Humanity (Privasea or similar)
  - Daily browsing thresholds
  - Algorithmic checks against artificial behavior
- Accumulates into Reputation Score

**Post-TGE Maintenance:**
- Must complete daily activities to maintain
- **Penalty system:**
  - 10% slashing per week of inactivity
  - Full slash to 0 after 6 consecutive weeks inactive
  - Forfeited Genesis Airdrop if applicable

### 2. $BTT (Main Token)
- Launched at Token Generation Event (TGE)
- Used for revenue distribution and staking
- Bought back from market using ad revenue

## Distribution Mechanisms

### Genesis Airdrop (at TGE)
- Based on $BROWSE holdings
- **Vesting structure:**
  - 40% unlocked immediately
  - 60% vests weekly over 12 months
  - Requires weekly participation
  - Missed weeks = permanent forfeiture
- **Forfeited tokens split:**
  - 50% to BitFinder Treasury
  - 50% to NFT holders

### NFT System (100-Day Streak Achievement)
**Requirements:**
- 100 consecutive days of daily activity
- Reaches "Max Reputation" status
- Mints soulbound NFT

**Benefits:**
- Access to ongoing ad revenue share
- Premium ecosystem privileges
- Optional: Immediate unlock of remaining Genesis Airdrop

**Maintenance:**
- Must remain weekly active
- Inactivity = temporary loss of revenue share eligibility

## Three Revenue Pathways

1. **Genesis Airdrop** - Initial allocation for early users
2. **Early Ecosystem Rewards** - 4-year structured emissions for $BROWSE holders
3. **NFT Revenue Share** - Ongoing ad-revenue distribution to active NFT holders

## Staking System

### Adaptive Locked Staking Model
**Key Features:**
- Fixed periods: 3M, 6M, 12M, 24M
- Early exit allowed BUT forfeit all rewards
- 7-day exit buffer period
- Forfeited rewards redistribution:
  - 50% to remaining pool participants
  - 50% to BitFinder Treasury

### Initial Staking Pools (First 30 Days)
| Lock Period | APY |
|------------|-----|
| 3 Months   | 8%  |
| 6 Months   | 13% |
| 12 Months  | 21% |
| 24 Months  | 40% |

- Each pool capped at 1.5% of total supply
- High initial incentives

### Ongoing Unlimited Pools
| Lock Period | APY (Starting) |
|------------|----------------|
| 3 Months   | 5%             |
| 6 Months   | 8%             |
| 12 Months  | 13%            |
| 24 Months  | 21%            |

- No participation cap
- Yields may reduce over time

### Staking Timeline Evolution
- **Years 1-2:** Fixed APY + modest revenue share
- **Years 3-4:** Tapering APY, increasing revenue share
- **Post-Year 4:** 100% revenue share, no token emissions

## Revenue Distribution Weights

### For Stakers (by lock duration):
- 3 Months: 1x weight
- 6 Months: 1.5x weight
- 12 Months: 2.5x weight
- 24 Months: 4x weight

## Key Design Principles

1. **Behavioral Loop:** User activity → Ad revenue → Token buybacks → User rewards
2. **Anti-Inflation:** Transition from emissions to revenue share over 4 years
3. **Commitment Rewards:** Longer commitments = higher rewards
4. **Activity Requirements:** Continuous engagement needed to maintain benefits
5. **Treasury Sustainability:** Multiple revenue streams to treasury

## Future Considerations (Exploratory)

- NFT tiering for extended streaks (200, 365 days)
- Reputation "prestige" loops
- Inactive user recovery mechanisms
- Dynamic NFT metadata
- Multiple NFT ownership
- Cross-utility unlocks (governance, early access, multipliers)

## Unique Aspects

1. **No Dilution on Exit:** Early staking exits benefit remaining participants
2. **Soulbound Elements:** Both $BROWSE and achievement NFTs are non-transferable
3. **Activity-Gated Rewards:** All major benefits require ongoing participation
4. **Progressive Decentralization:** From emissions to pure revenue share model
